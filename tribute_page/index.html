                <p> Lily is a little Dapple Dachshund puppy with the bluest eyes. She has 5 other siblings - all boys! She was not only the only female to be born in her litter, but also the smallest.
                    After taking her and her brothers for their first vaccination, Lily got really sick two days later. She was already so small and fragile, and seeing her lose even more weight was frightening. We thought maybe she had Cat Flu so we took her back to the vet. The vet told us it was just a stomach virus, and gave us the necessary medication. After expecting the worst, it was a relief to know she would be alright.
                    A few days went by of us nursing her back to good health. Giving her medication was no easy task! But luckily, we saw that she was getting better.
                </p>
                <p> Once Lily was better, we had the most enjoyable time with her. She loves eating! So whenever she's' done eating she looks as round as a ball, and will wobble around for a while - it's the cutest thing to see. She's also so playful, and she'll run after you when she sees you walking. It's summer now so when it's too hot she's the laziest dog to ever exist. She lies down in her bed, on our shoulders, on our bed, basically anywhere. 
                    But she really knows how to make herself comfortable, you'll find her lying on her back, stomach facing upward, sleeping the day away. It's why we call her the cutest little potato pup!

                <p> She brings a smile to everyone's faces and keeps us laughing. She's a little ball full of sunshine and love. We are very lucky to have her around. We can't wait to see how she grows up.
