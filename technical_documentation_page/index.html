                    <p>
                        The previous 2017 Kindle Oasis undeniably had that luxury feel to it. So it's unsurprising that
                        this new Kindle Oasis didn't stray far from its previous design elements. The All-new Kindle lost some of it's
                        weight due to them removing the rear-housing magents that attached the cases to the previous model. It
                        went from 6.8 ounces to 6.6. However, the aluminum backplate (also available in Graphite or Champagne Gold), glossy
                        black bezel, and glare-free glass are still here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you like reading in the bathtub or on the beach, but you're afraid of dropping your Kindle Oasis in the water,
                        then fear not, because this new model has an IPX8 rating, which means it can survive being submersed in water up to
                        two meters for an hour at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, this model has an adjustable front light feature. You can adjust the color tone of your
                        screen from warm to cool to better suit day or night reading by dragging your finger left to right on the screen.
                        You can also schedule the warmth level to change automatically with sunrise and sunset.
                    </p>
                    <p>The new Kindle Oasis comes in 8GB and 32GB models. You can choose which one is best for you when you consider your reading
                        habits and if you prefer ebooks or storage-sucking audiobooks. Audiobooks will also deplete the Oasis' battery faster.

                        The price for the Kindle Oasis depends on the size you take and whether you're alright with ads or not.
                        The base level device is the 8GB Kindle which starts at $250 if you can tolerate the ads. The same Kindle is 
                        available without ads for $270. A 32GB Kindle Oasis with ads runs at $280, and at $300 without ads. Remember, there is
                        also the three month free trial for Kindle Unlimited, and you will pay $10 monthly if you choose to keep the
                        subscription thereafter.
